<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>W</FONT></B>elcome to the <STRONG>EDK II
FAT-Driver PROJECT</STRONG>, a project for the EDK II FAT32 File
System Driver, which is based on Microsoft's FAT32 File System Driver
Specification. The EDK II Fat Driver is separate from the EDK II
project only because the terms of use of the code are unique,
requiring us to keep it in a separate code repository (the terms are
basically that code developed using the FAT32 Specification must be
associated with EFI). 
</P>
<P>This project is a <EM>subproject</EM> of the EDK II project, and
is only used to house the FAT32 code repository. All development
tools in the EDK project are integrated with this project, so come
here only to update the CVS repository or to get access to the latest
code snapshots. Use the EDK project to post issues, join mailing
lists, participate in discussion forums, etc. In short, consider them
one project with two code repositories.</P>
<H3><A NAME="stop"></A>EDK II FAT-Driver News</H3>
<P>The EDK II FAT-Driver development team is pleased to announce a
new <B>&quot;Enhanced&quot;</B> FAT-Driver. This project will now be
used to develop and maintain both drivers. From this point on, the
original FAT-Driver will be referred to as <B>FAT-Driver</B> while
the new driver will go by the <B>Enhanced-FAT-Driver</B> name. Both
drivers will be using the same Project Tracer and each have their own
<B>module</B> name when creating/modifying TASKs or ENHANCEMENTs. The
enhanced-fat-driver is also published under the same license as the
fat-driver2. To view more specific information about the
enhanced-fat-driver, go to the <A HREF="#Enhanced_Fat_Driver">Enhanced-FAT-Driver</A>
section. 
</P>
<H3>Working with the FAT32 Code</H3>
<P>The FAT-Driver project is sponsored by Intel and released under
the BSD License with one additional term. Before using the code
please read the license below, paying special attention to the
&quot;Additional Terms&quot; section:</P>

<P>To download code, view the <A HREF="http://fat-driver2.tianocore.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=10&amp;expandFolder=10&amp;folderID=0">directory
of code snapshots</A> and choose the version (Official Release or
Development Version) you are interested in and simply click on it to
start the download process. Join this project if you want to
contribute code changes (see the next section for guidance).

<H3><A NAME="Enhanced_Fat_Driver"></A>Enhanced-FAT-Driver</H3>
<P>The <B>Enhanced-FAT-Driver</B> is a new implementation of the
FAT32 filesystem. It is a near complete rewrite of the original
FAT-Driver with over 80% of the code being specific just to the
Enhanced-FAT-Driver. The new driver is faster and takes up only 66%
of the original FAT-Driver's memory footprint.

<H4><!-- <p>
When making your decision, remember that the Enhanced FAT-Driver is backward compatible with the original FAT-Driver. 
It also has a sector allocation mechanism that can make it easier to recover deleted files.
</p> -->What
does this mean to you?</H4>
<P>The source code will be housed in the same repository so there is
no need to checkout multiple projects to work on these drivers. The
Project Tracker configuration is setup to allow for concurrent
DEFECT, ENHANCEMENT and TASK management for both projects. The only
real concern for you is to figure out which driver to use when.
