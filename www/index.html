<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>W</FONT></B>elcome to the <STRONG>EDK II
FAT-Driver PROJECT</STRONG>, a project for the EDK II FAT32 File
System Driver, which is based on Microsoft's FAT32 File System Driver
Specification. The EDK II Fat Driver is separate from the EDK II
project only because the terms of use of the code are unique,
requiring us to keep it in a separate code repository (the terms are
basically that code developed using the FAT32 Specification must be
associated with EFI). The EDK II Fat Driver is structured as a
Package that fits into the EDK II's overall build and packaging
system.</P>
<P>This project is a <EM>subproject</EM> of the EDK II project, and
is only used to house the FAT32 code repository. All development
tools in the EDK project are integrated with this project, so come
here only to update the Subversion repository or to get access to the
latest code snapshots. Use the EDK project to post issues, join
mailing lists, participate in discussion forums, etc. In short,
consider them one project with two code repositories.</P>

<H4><A NAME="Enhanced_Fat_Driver"></A>Enhanced-FAT-Driver</H4>
<P>The <B>Enhanced-FAT-Driver</B> is a new implementation of the
FAT32 filesystem. It is a near complete rewrite of the original
FAT-Driver with over 80% of the code being specific just to the
Enhanced-FAT-Driver. The new driver is faster and takes up only 66%
of the original FAT-Driver's memory footprint.
